Fuselage is a WIP operating system that I'm using to learn things about OS dev.

While I'm trying to follow good practices I don't know much about OS dev (yet), so run this at your own risk. It probably has a good chance of breaking something if you run it on real hardware. Maybe.

## Resources

I've tried to write many operating systems where I've mostly copied and pasted code from a different operating system. Fun, but I didn't learn much, and got stuck once I got to the point where there were no more things to copy. So, I'm trying to avoid that this time. However, I am looking at other operating systems and resources, and I'm trying to link the ones I find useful here.
